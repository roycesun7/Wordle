# Wordle

This project is a clone of the popular game Wordle, where a player has 6 guesses to try and guess a random 5-letter word. After each registered guess, 
the game will color-code each letter with gray if the letter is not in the answer, yellow if it is but isn't in the right position, and green if the 
letter is in the right position compared with the answer. 

The Wordle file contains all the classes that make up the game tiles and board. This project is built with an MVC (model-view-controller) framework. 
Run the game by running the Wordle/RunGame file.
